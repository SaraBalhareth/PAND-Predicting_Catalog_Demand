### PAND-Predicting_Catalog_Demand
You recently started working for a company that manufactures and sells high-end home goods. Last year the company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to.

Youâ€™ve been asked as a business analyst to predict the expected profit from these 250 new customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.  

### Details:
- The costs of printing and distributing is $6.50 per catalog. 
- The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is 50%. 
- Make sure to multiply your revenue by the gross margin first before you subtract out the $6.50 cost when calculating your profit.
